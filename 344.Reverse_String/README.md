write this in md code "Parameters
s: A list of characters (e.g., ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']).
Local Variables
l: An integer initialized to 0, representing the left pointer starting at the beginning of the list.
r: An integer initialized to len(s) - 1, representing the right pointer starting at the end of the list.
Method Logic
Initialization:

l is set to 0 (the start of the list).
r is set to len(s) - 1 (the end of the list).
Loop Condition:

The while loop continues as long as l is less than r.
Swapping Elements:

Inside the loop, the elements at positions l and r are swapped.
The expression s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l] swaps the elements at the l and r indices.
Updating Pointers:

After swapping, l is incremented by 1 to move the left pointer towards the center.
Similarly, r is decremented by 1 to move the right pointer towards the center.
Termination:

The loop terminates when l is no longer less than r, meaning the entire list has been reversed.
