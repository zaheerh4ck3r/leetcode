## Explanation of the Solution

This solution employs dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of possible attendance records of length 'n' that make a student eligible for an attendance award. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize `prevDP` as a 2D list with dimensions 2x3, representing the number of valid records ending with 'A' (absent) or 'P' (present) and the count of consecutive 'L's respectively. Initialize each cell of `prevDP` with 1, representing the number of valid records of length 0 with no absences or late days.

2. **Dynamic Programming Iteration**:
   - Iterate through each day from 1 to 'n'.
   - For each day, calculate a new 2D list `newDP` to store the counts of valid records for the current day.
   - For each possible combination of absences ('A') and consecutive late days ('L'):
     - Update the counts for records ending with 'P':
       - Add the count of valid records ending with 'P' from the previous day.
       - If there was at least one absence on the previous day ('A > 0'), add the count of valid records ending with 'A' from the previous day.
       - If there was at least one consecutive late day on the previous day ('L > 0'), add the count of valid records ending with 'L' from the previous day.
       - Update the count modulo 'MOD' to prevent overflow.
   - Update `prevDP` with the values of `newDP` for the next iteration.

3. **Return Result**: Finally, return the count of valid records of length 'n' ending with 'A' (absent) and with at least one consecutive late day ('L > 0').

This solution efficiently calculates the number of valid attendance records by considering the conditions for eligibility iteratively. It ensures that all possible combinations of records are accounted for, resulting in an accurate count.
