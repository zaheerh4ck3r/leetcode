```python
class Solution(object):
    def postorder(self, root):
        if not root:
            return []

        res, stack = [], [root]
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            res.append(node.val)
            stack.extend(node.children) 
        
        return res[::-1]

```
### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The code starts by checking if the `root` is `None`. If it is, the function immediately returns an empty list since there is no tree to traverse.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Two lists are initialized: `res` to store the postorder traversal result, and `stack` which is initialized with the `root` node. The `stack` is used to help traverse the tree iteratively.

3. **Iterative Traversal**:
   - A `while` loop is used to iterate as long as there are elements in the `stack`.
   - In each iteration, the node at the top of the `stack` is popped and its value is appended to the `res` list.
   - The `children` of the current node are then extended into the `stack`. This adds all the child nodes to the stack, ensuring they will be processed in subsequent iterations.

4. **Reversing the Result**:
   - The `res` list is reversed before returning it. This is necessary because the values were appended in a manner that corresponds to a reversed postorder traversal (due to the nature of the stack), so reversing them gives the correct postorder sequence.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the `res` list and the `stack`, which in the worst case can hold all the nodes in the tree.
