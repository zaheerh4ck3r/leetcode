# Intuition
The problem involves finding a specific value 'x' such that there are exactly 'x' numbers in the array that are greater than or equal to 'x'. 

# Approach
1. Sort the array in descending order to make it easier to count the numbers greater than or equal to a certain value.
2. Iterate through all possible values of 'x' from 0 to the length of the array.
3. For each 'x', count the numbers greater than or equal to 'x' using a generator expression and the 'sum' function.
4. If the count matches 'x', return 'x' as the result, as it indicates a special array.
5. If no such 'x' is found, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
   - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, where 'n' is the length of the array.
   - The loop iterates through all possible values of 'x', taking O(n) time.
   - Inside the loop, counting the numbers greater than or equal to 'x' also takes O(n) time.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + n^2), which simplifies to O(n^2).
- Space complexity: O(1) since the sorting is performed in-place and only constant extra space is used.
