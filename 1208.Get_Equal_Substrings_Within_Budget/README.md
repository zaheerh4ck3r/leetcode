# Intuition
The problem can be solved using a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of a substring that can be changed within the given maxCost. 

# Approach
 We initialize variables to track the maximum length, start of the window, and the current cost. Then, we iterate through the strings using a sliding window. We calculate the cost of changing characters and adjust the window to keep the cost within the maximum allowed. Finally, we update the maximum length of the substring that can be changed. 

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t. This is because we only iterate through the strings once with the sliding window technique. 

- Space complexity:
The space complexity of the solution is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store variables regardless of the input size.
