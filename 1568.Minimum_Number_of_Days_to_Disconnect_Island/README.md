### Explanation of the Solution

The problem is to determine the minimum number of days required to disconnect a grid, where the grid consists of land (`1`s) and water (`0`s). The grid is considered "disconnected" if the land is divided into two or more separate islands, or if there is no land left.

#### Approach:

1. **Grid Exploration**:
   The solution starts by exploring the grid to identify connected components of land, which we can think of as "islands." The goal is to see how many islands exist and whether they are already disconnected.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   The algorithm uses DFS to explore all the land cells connected to a starting cell. This helps in identifying all the cells that belong to the same island. If multiple islands are found during this exploration, the grid is already disconnected.

3. **Initial Check**:
   Before making any changes to the grid, the algorithm checks if the grid is already disconnected. If it is, no further action is needed, and the answer is `0` days.

4. **Attempt to Disconnect by Removing One Cell**:
   If the grid is not already disconnected, the algorithm tries removing one land cell at a time. After removing each cell, it checks if the grid becomes disconnected. If it does, the answer is `1` day because disconnecting the grid took only one removal.

5. **Final Attempt by Removing Two Cells**:
   If removing a single land cell does not disconnect the grid, the algorithm concludes that removing two land cells is necessary. This is the worst-case scenario since removing two strategically chosen land cells will definitely disconnect the grid.

#### Summary:

- The solution first checks if the grid is already disconnected.
- If not, it attempts to disconnect the grid by removing one land cell.
- If that fails, it determines that two cells must be removed to disconnect the grid.

Thus, the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid can be either `0`, `1`, or `2`, depending on the initial configuration of the grid and the placement of the land cells.
