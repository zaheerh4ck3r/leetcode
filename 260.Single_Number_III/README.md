#Problem Description
In this problem, we are given an integer array nums where precisely two elements are unique, appearing only once, and the rest of the elements appear exactly two times. The task is to find the two unique elements without using additional space and ensuring that the algorithm runs in linear time complexity. This means we cannot sort the array or use a data structure that would take up extra space proportional to the input size. The uniqueness of our solution should come from cleverly manipulating the numbers themselves to identify the two that are different from the rest.

#Intuition
To solve this problem efficiently, we should utilize the properties of the XOR (^) bitwise operation. When we apply XOR to two identical numbers, the result is zero; when we apply it to a number and zero, we get the original number back. These properties are crucial:

If we XOR a number with itself, we get 0 (
�
⊕
�
=
0
x⊕x=0).
Any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged (
�
⊕
0
=
�
x⊕0=x).
When we XOR all numbers in the array, we are left with the XOR of the two unique numbers, since all other numbers cancel each other out (pairwise XORing them gives us 0).

Now, since the two unique numbers are distinct, their XOR result must have at least one bit set to 1, representing a place where they differ. If we can isolate this bit, we can divide all numbers in the array into two groups, based on whether they have this bit set to 1 or not. This step ensures that each group contains exactly one of the unique numbers, with all others still forming cancelling pairs.

We obtain such a bit using xs & -xs, which isolates the lowest bit that is set to 1 in the XOR result.

With this bit as a mask, we iterate through all the numbers again, using the mask to split the numbers into two groups and performing XOR in each group to find the unique numbers. We are guaranteed that:

All duplicates will still cancel out within their respective groups.
The two unique numbers will fall into separate groups and won't cancel out.
The final result of the XOR operation in each group is the unique number within that group.
Thus, this process leaves us with the two numbers that appear only once in the array, meeting our time and space complexity requirements.

#Solution Approach
The solution uses the bitwise XOR operation to pinpoint the two unique numbers in the array. The XOR operation is chosen for its ability to cancel out pairs of identical numbers, meaning that XOR-ing all numbers in an array where each number appears twice, except for two numbers, will leave us with the XOR of these two unique numbers.

Here are the steps to this approach, using bitwise operations in Python:

We first apply XOR to all the elements in the array, which is conveniently done using the reduce() function with the xor operator from Python's functools module. The result of this operation is stored in variable xs and can be mathematically represented as:

xs = nums[0] ^ nums[1] ^ ... ^ nums[n - 1]
Since XOR-ing a number with itself results in 0, and any number XOR-ed with 0 is the number itself, all paired numbers cancel each other, and we are left with:

xs = unique1 ^ unique2
We need to find a way to separate unique1 and unique2. Since they are distinct, there must be at least one bit in which they differ. The line of code lb = xs & -xs finds the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the XOR result (xs). The -xs is a way to get the two's complement which flips all the bits of xs and adds 1, so when it’s AND-ed with xs, all the bits are canceled out except for the least significant bit.

With this bit (lb), we divide the numbers into two groups and XOR the numbers in each group to find the unique numbers. This step is done by iterating through the array again with:

for x in nums:
    if x & lb:
        a ^= x
This code XORs all numbers that have the lb bit set. Since all other numbers appear twice, only unique1 or unique2 (whichever has that bit set) will be the result of this XOR operation (a holds this unique number).

To find the second unique number, XOR a with xs:

b = xs ^ a
Since xs is unique1 ^ unique2, by XOR-ing it with one unique number, the other is revealed, giving us b, the second unique number.

The final result, [a, b], contains the two numbers that occur only once in the array. The use of bitwise operations, along with the loop through the array, ensures that the algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), with constant space complexity, O(1), as it employs a fixed number of integer variables regardless of the input size.
