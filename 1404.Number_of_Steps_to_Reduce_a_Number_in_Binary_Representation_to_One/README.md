## Explanation of Binary String Conversion Algorithm

**Class and Method Definition**

This code defines a class named `Solution` that inherits from the base class `object` in Python. The class has a single method named `numSteps`. The docstring above the method describes its functionality:

* **`numSteps` method:**
    * Takes a string `s` as input, representing a binary number.
    * Returns an integer, which is the minimum number of steps required to convert the binary string to a string containing only a single '0'.

**Method Breakdown**

The `numSteps` method performs the following steps to convert a binary string to a string with a single '0':

**1. Initialization:**

* Initializes a variable `steps` to 0, which keeps track of the total number of steps taken.
* Converts the input string `s` to a list of characters, as strings are immutable in Python and we need to modify the characters.

**2. Looping Until Single '0' Remains:**

* The code uses a `while` loop that continues as long as the length of the list `s` is greater than 1 (i.e., there's more than one character in the string).

**3. Handling Even and Odd Cases:**

* Inside the loop, it checks the last element (index -1) of the list `s`.
    * **Even Binary Number (Last element is '0')**
        * We can simply remove the last digit (division by 2) using `s.pop()`.
    * **Odd Binary Number (Last element is '1')**
        * This might cause a carry-over effect when adding 1.
        * The code iterates through the list from the end, flipping '1' to '0' as long as the current character is '1'.
        * If the loop iterates through the entire list without finding a '0' (all ones), a carry-over occurs, and a '1' is prepended to the list using `s.insert(0, '1')`.
        * Otherwise, the character at the index where the loop stopped (first encountered '0') is flipped to '1' using `s[i] = '1'`.

**4. Increment Steps and Continue Loop:**

* After processing either an even or odd case, the `steps` counter is incremented by 1 to account for the operation performed.

**5. Return Minimum Steps:**

* Once the loop terminates (when the length of `s` becomes 1, which is a single '0'), the method returns the final value of `steps`, which represents the minimum number of steps required for the conversion.

**In essence, this code implements an algorithm to efficiently convert a binary string to a string containing a single '0' by handling even and odd cases along with potential carry-over operations.**
