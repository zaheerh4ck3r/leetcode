#Intuition

To solve this problem, we begin by thinking about the properties of XOR. A key insight is that the XOR operation is both associative and commutative, which implies that the order of elements does not change the result of the XOR. Another insight is that XOR-ing a number with itself yields zero. By taking advantage of this, we can precompute the XOR of all elements up to k for every index k in the array, storing the results in a prefix XOR array pre.

This precomputation allows us to find the XOR of any subarray in constant time. For any two indices i and j, the XOR of the subarray from i to j-1 can be obtained by pre[j] ^ pre[i]. This is because pre[j] contains the XOR of all elements up to j-1 and pre[i] contains the XOR of all elements up to i-1. So, when we XOR these two, all the elements before i are nullified, leaving just the XOR of the subarray.

The next step is to check every possible combination of (i, j, k). This requires three nested loops. For each triplet:

We calculate a as the XOR of the subarray from i to j-1.
We calculate b as the XOR of the subarray from j to k.
We check if a is equal to b.
If a equals b, we increment our answer count (ans). After considering all possible triplets, ans will contain the total number of triplets for which a equals b.

The solution's time complexity is O(n^3) due to the use of three nested loops, which might not be the most efficient for large input arrays. However, for the purpose of understanding the problem, this brute force approach shows the direct application of XOR properties and precomputed prefix sums to solve the problem.


#Solution Approach

In the implementation of the solution for counting the triplets that satisfy a == b where a and b are defined through the bitwise XOR operation, we use the prefix sum pattern with a slight tweak - using XOR instead of addition.

The steps of the implementation include:

Initialization:

Calculate the length of the input array arr and denote it as n.
Initialize a list pre with a length of n + 1 to store the prefix XOR values. The pre[i] will store the XOR of all elements from the beginning of the array up to the i-1th index.
Precomputation:

We calculate the prefix XOR sequence by iterating through the input array and performing the XOR operation for each element. The pre[0] is set to be 0 as a base case since XOR with 0 gives us the number itself, which starts our sequence.
Triplets Counting:

After the precomputation step, we iterate over all potential starting indices i for the array segment a.
For each i, iterate over all potential starting indices j where j > i for the array segment b. Note that j can also be the ending index of segment a.
For each pair (i, j), iterate over all possible ending indices k for the segment b where k >= j.
Compute a as pre[j] ^ pre[i] which gives the XOR of the subarray from i to j-1.
Compute b as pre[k + 1] ^ pre[j] which gives the XOR of the subarray from j to k.
If a equals b, increment the counter ans.
Return the result:

After iterating through all triplets, the counter ans holds the number of triplets satisfying a == b. Return ans.
This brute-force algorithm uses the concept of prefix sums along with the properties of XOR to solve the problem in a straightforward way. The primary data structure used here is the array for storing prefix XORs. The pattern utilized is a classic computational geometry approach to handle subarray or subrange queries efficiently by preparation combined with a brute-force enumeration of triplets.


#Example walkthrough
Let's illustrate the solution approach with an example. Suppose we have the following array:

arr = [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
Following the solution approach:

Initialization:

The length of the array n is 6.
We initialize a list pre with length n + 1 to store the prefix XOR values. Thus, pre has 7 elements.
Precomputation:

We set pre[0] to 0. We then iterate over the array to fill in the rest of the pre array with prefix XOR values:
arr: [ 3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8 ]
pre: [ 0, 3, 9, 12, 21, 23, 31 ]
Triplets Counting:

We iterate over all combinations of i, j, and k to find all possible (i, j, k) triplets:
For i = 0, j = 1, and k = 2, we have:
a = pre[j] ^ pre[i] = pre[1] ^ pre[0] = 3 ^ 0 = 3
b = pre[k + 1] ^ pre[j] = pre[3] ^ pre[1] = 12 ^ 3 = 9
Since a is not equal to b, we do not increment ans.
For i = 0, j = 2, and k = 3, we have:
a = pre[j] ^ pre[i] = pre[2] ^ pre[0] = 9 ^ 0 = 9
b = pre[k + 1] ^ pre[j] = pre[4] ^ pre[2] = 21 ^ 9 = 12
Since a is not equal to b, we do not increment ans.
We continue this process for all possible i, j, and k.
For i = 1, j = 3, and k = 5, we find that:
a = pre[j] ^ pre[i] = pre[3] ^ pre[1] = 12 ^ 3 = 9
b = pre[k + 1] ^ pre[j] = pre[6] ^ pre[3] = 31 ^ 12 = 19
a is not equal to b, so ans remains unchanged.
Finally, upon reaching i = 1, j = 4, and k = 5, we get:
a = pre[j] ^ pre[i] = pre[4] ^ pre[1] = 21 ^ 3 = 22
b = pre[k + 1] ^ pre[j] = pre[6] ^ pre[4] = 31 ^ 21 = 10
Once again, a is not equal to b.
This iterative process is performed for all combinations to search for a == b.
Return the result:

After considering all combinations of i, j, k in array arr, we calculated the value of a and b for each triplet and compared them for equality.
In our example, letâ€™s say there were no instances where a equaled b. Therefore, the answer ans is 0.
In this example, we did not find any triplets such that a == b. However, we followed the solution approach closely to check for all possible triplets and calculate the XOR for the segments defined by i, j, and k.
