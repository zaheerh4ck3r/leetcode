### Approach

1. **Count Total Ones**:
   - Compute `total_ones`, the total number of `1`s in the array `nums`. This is crucial because it defines the size of the sliding window that will be used to track the segment of the array where all `1`s should be grouped.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `total_ones` is `0` (i.e., no `1`s in the array) or `total_ones` is equal to `n` (i.e., all elements are `1`s), then no swaps are needed. The function immediately returns `0` for these cases.

3. **Initialize Sliding Window**:
   - Calculate the number of `0`s in the initial window of size `total_ones`. This is achieved using a generator expression that iterates through the first `total_ones` elements and counts how many of them are `0`. This count represents the number of swaps needed to convert the initial window into all `1`s.

4. **Slide the Window**:
   - Use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the minimum number of zeros within any window of size `total_ones` as the window slides across the array. The array is conceptually circular, so sliding the window beyond the end of the array wraps around to the beginning.

5. **Window Updates**:
   - For each new position of the window:
     - **Remove the effect** of the element that exits the window (i.e., the leftmost element of the previous window). If it was a `0`, decrement the `current_zeros` count.
     - **Add the effect** of the new element that enters the window (i.e., the rightmost element of the current window). If it is a `0`, increment the `current_zeros` count.
     - Update the `min_swaps` with the minimum value between the current minimum and the new `current_zeros` count.

6. **Return Result**:
   - After sliding the window across all possible positions, return the minimum number of swaps required, which corresponds to `min_swaps`.
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        total_ones = sum(nums)
        
        # Edge cases
        if total_ones == 0 or total_ones == n:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize the number of zeros in the first window
        current_zeros = sum(1 for i in range(total_ones) if nums[i] == 0)
        min_swaps = current_zeros
        
        # Slide the window and update the number of zeros
        for i in range(total_ones, n + total_ones):
            out_idx = (i - total_ones) % n
            in_idx = i % n
            
            # Remove the effect of the element going out of the window
            if nums[out_idx] == 0:
                current_zeros -= 1
            
            # Add the effect of the new element coming into the window
            if nums[in_idx] == 0:
                current_zeros += 1
            
            # Update the minimum swaps required
            min_swaps = min(min_swaps, current_zeros)
        
        return min_swaps
```

### Summary

The solution effectively uses a sliding window to track the number of `0`s in a window of size equal to the number of `1`s in the array. By efficiently managing the window and handling the circular nature of the array, it computes the minimum number of swaps needed to group all `1`s together in linear time.
